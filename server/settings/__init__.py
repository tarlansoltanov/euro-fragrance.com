"""
Django Project - Settings Module.

This module is responsible for loading the all component setting files and
correct settings file based on the environment variable DJANGO_ENV.
The default value is 'local', so if you don't specify
the environment variable, the local settings will be loaded.

For more information, see the documentation:
